# Intermediate Javascript Assessments

### Without using Google answer the following:

1. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

.map will do something to every index and will return an array of the same size, while .filter will only do something to the indexes that meet a certain criteria and will normally return a smaller array. 

2. Why would you use object destructuring?

You would use object destructuring to save time when writing your code and for it to be more readable. Being able to type just a one word variable or method name instead of this.state.variableName over and over again makes it a valuable tool. 

3. What is the difference between var, let, and const?

const is how you would set a variable that you do not want to change.
Let is for a variable with local scope.
var is for a variable with global scope.

4. Why is testing important?

Testing is important because it saves time seeing if your code works; it is quicker than calling the function with different variables to see if it works. It helps you to catch any bugs and make the changes you need. It also is helpful to do testing while you are creating your application because it helps you organize what you are trying to do.

5. What is a higher order function?

A higher order function is a function that either returns a function or takes a function in as an argument.

6. What is the difference between a class and an object?

A class is a blue print for an object, and an object is the relationship between data and behavior. 

7. What did you learn during the group project this week? Please include any additional feedback you may have.

In the group project, I learned just how benifical working in pairs/mobs can be. Talking through problems is very helpful for me, and it is obviously a staple in that method of programming. I would not have been able to get to the end product in that amount of time working alone, if I had been able to get there at all. I certainly would not have learned as much, either. 


### HTML/CSS Review questions: First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. How do you link a CSS file to your HTML page?

To link a css file to your html page, you include a link tag in the head of your document with the file path to your css file. 

Google: 
Each page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element. The <link> element goes inside the <head> section:

2. What is the difference between a div and a span?

A div is a block level element, while a span is an inline element.

Google:
The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code.

3. What is a CSS class? When should you use an id instead of a class?

A css class is a hook you add onto an element in order to style it. An id is the same, but you can only use one id of the same name per page. If you want to reuse a hook on a page, you would use a class. 

Google:
The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.

4. Name 4 semantic HTML tags.

nav, article, section, aside

Google:
<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>

5. What are three options for creating responsive design?

Including the responsive meta tag in the head of the page, making your images be responsive by setting their style to be max-width: 100% and height: auto, and using media queries to have different styles at different screen sizes.


### Stretch: The following questions are potential interview questions. First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. What is front end development? Can you identify any tools/skills that are uniquely required of front end developers?

Front end development is developing what the user sees and interacts with. A front end developer would need strong knowledge of html, css, and other front end languages such as JavaScript. Being a front end developer means that you will likely be working with clients about the design of their website, which means you'll need to be able to communicate with people who do not have the technical knowledge you do. Front end developers also need to be aware of things like UX. 

2. What is block scope in JavaScript?

3. How would you explain the idea of "inheritance" in object oriented programming?

I would explain it in terms of inheritance from css styles. If you set some styles on divs, like font size and font color, and then you put an h1 inside a div, it will take on those styles. But if you can still add or change those styles affecting that h1 by using a different hook and changing the styles, and you can do that over and over again on multiple divs and any child element of that div.
